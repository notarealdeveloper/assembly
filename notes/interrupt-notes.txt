# IRQ = Interrupt request
# An interrupt request (or IRQ) is a hardware signal sent to the processor 
# that temporarily stops a running program and allows a special program, 
# an interrupt handler, to run instead. Interrupts are used to handle such 
# events as data receipt from a modem or network, or a key press or mouse 
# movement. 

# Interrupt request level = IRQL 
# The priority of an interrupt request.

# Interrupt handlers:
# (1) FLIH = First-Level Interrupt Handler. Very fast.
# (2) SLIH = Second-Level Interrupt Handler. "Deferred Procedure Call"
#
# Masking:
# FLIHs which service hardware typically mask their associated interrupt
# (or possibly just keep it masked) until they complete their execution.
# I guess this prevents neverending preemption -> stack overflow -> death.

# On Linux, IRQ mappings can be viewed with:
cat /proc/interrupts
